# Running the Server
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed ( [download here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/ "Node Download") )
2. From command line: `npm install` in this directory
3. `npm start` to start up the server
You should then be able to access the website by going to the address printed in the terminal (eg: `http://192.168.1.12:3000`)
This will open the web navigation part of the server

## To Post/Upload to Server
To create a new marker/tag go to `http://serveraddress/create`
for developers: send POSTs to `http://serveraddress/upload`
