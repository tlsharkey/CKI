# Capitalism Kills Itself
CKI is part of a larger Speculative Design Senior Project group at UC San Diego. The project takes the premise of a city which is governed by an Affective AI. This particular group considers the nature of society in a world where automation has run rampant as a result of AI and new technologies. We imagine capitalist forces pushing for automation - and inadvertently destroying the consumer class by depraving them of work and thereby money.
The displaced workers attempt to attain a Universal Basic Income from the United States government, but the government fails to listen to its people. Ironically, it ends up being the companies who convince the government to grant a Universal Basic Income - an attempt to recreate the consumer class by giving everyone money. Wealthy CEOs became willing to pay heavy taxes for redistribution, for the chance of making even more through sales.
In this new world people have a some small amount of money and a lot of time. This causes a massive shift in the social sphere as people begin to do more. DIY culture peaks, backyard gardens are the norm, and travel has extablished itself as a favorite passtime.
